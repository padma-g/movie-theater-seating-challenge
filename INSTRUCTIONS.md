# Walmart Interview: Movie Theater Seating Challenge
Padma Gundapaneni

## Overview
Implement an algorithm for assigning seats within a movie theater to
fulfill reservation requests. Assume the movie theater has the seating
arrangement of 10 rows x 20 seats, as illustrated to the right.
Your homework assignment is to design and write a seat assignment
program to maximize both customer satisfaction and customer
safety. For the purpose of public safety, assume that a buffer of three
seats and/or one row is required.

### Input Description
You will be given a file that contains one line of input for each
reservation request. The order of the lines in the file reflects the order in
which the reservation requests were received. Each line in the file will be
comprised of a reservation identifier, followed by a space, and then the
number of seats requested. The reservation identifier will have the
format: R####. See the Example Input File Rows section for an
example of the input rows.

### Output Description
The program should output a file containing the seating assignments for
each request. Each row in the file should include the reservation number
followed by a space, and then a comma-delimited list of the assigned
seats. See the Example Output File Rows section for an example of
the output file content.

## Requirements
- Implement your solution using a programming language that
you are comfortable with. We work in Java, but we are more
interested in understanding how you think than in language
specifics.
- The solution and tests should build and execute entirely via the
command line.
- The command for executing the program should accept the
complete path to the input file as an argument and should
return the full path to the output file.
- Create a README file that documents your assumptions and
includes instructions for building the solution and executing the
tests.

We value your time, and anticipate that you will limit your investment in
this exercise to 3 - 4 hours. Feel free to make trade-offs to save time,
but consider how you would evolve your code to an ideal
implementation. Your solution will be reviewed by engineers that you will
be working with if you join the team. We are interested in seeing your
software design, coding, and testing skills.
